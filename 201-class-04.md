# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links
When content is surrounded by the `<a></a>` tags, they can be clicked on to be taken to another page. That page is specified by using the *href* attribute in the opening tag.

### Types of Link Elements
1. Linking to other sites - Uses an **absolute URL** to link to another site (ex: `<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>`)
2. Link to other pages on the same site - Uses a **relative URL** to link to a page within the same site (ex: `<a href="index.html">Home/</a>`)
3. Email links - Link that starts up the user's email program to start composing an email to a specified email address (ex: `<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>`)
4. Opening links in a new window - ex: `<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">IMDB</a>`
5. Link to a specific part of the same page - The part of the page you want to go to has to have an **id attribute** (ex: `<a href="#prologue">Prologue</a>`)
6. Link to a specific part of another page - ex: `<a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/#prologue">Prologue</a>`

## Types of CSS Positioning Schemes
1. Static Positioning (Normal Flow) - Default positioning. Sits where it sits in the HTML
2. Relative Positioning - Can be moved out of its normal flow or position. Will still take up the same space. It's relative to itself; offset. Used by a "parent."
3. Absolute Positioning - Is relative to its "parent." Can be taken out of its normal flow / positioning. Leaves no space behind.
4. Fixed Positioning - Is relative to the document body.
5. Floating Elements - Content flows around it.
