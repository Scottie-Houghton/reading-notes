# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding
1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
* It was roughly around the same time as personal computers becoming a fixture in U.S. home in significant numbers.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
* As personal computers became more prevalent in homes, computer science professors would assume their students had grown up playing with computers at home. Since computers in the 80's were mostly marketed to boys, they were the ones that were most likely to have previous experience with computers.

## Why Diversity Matters to Your Tech Company
1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
* Commitment is needed from the company leaders and they need to understand why diversity matters.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
* Studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between diverse companies and positive financial outcomes. This is thought to be the case because diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
* The developer team at YouTube that built the iOS app were almost entirely right-handed. Since they never considered how left-handed people would use the app, 5 - 10% of videos uploaded were upside down.
