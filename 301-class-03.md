# Passing Functions as Props

## React Docs - list and keys
1. What does .map() return?
* After running, .map() will return an array with new values.
2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
* Declare a variable that will hold the array the .map() returns from looping through the array. Within the .map() method, you will have a function with the values of the array being represented as a parameter and then passes them into elements by putting curly brackets around the parameter. Then, after that, further down in the code, but the variable you declare, surrounded by curly brackets, between the opening and closing brackets of an element.
3. Each list item needs a unique ____.
* `<li>` element
4. What is the purpose of a key?
* Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

## The Spread Operator
1. What is the spread operator?
* In JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (`â€¦`) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.
2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
* Copying an array
* Concatenating or combining arrays
* Using Math functions
* Using an array as an argument
3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
* `const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]`
4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
* `const moreFruits = [...fruits];`
5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
* 
`const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo}`

## How to Pass Functions Between Components
1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
* Create a function wherever the state we are going to change is.
2. In your own words, what does the `increment` function do?
* Maps through the array of objects to look for the first value of each object (name) and then increment the second value of the object (count) by one.
3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
* Add `increment={this.increment}` inside the `<Person/>`, like this `<Person increment={this.increment}/>`.
4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
* Like this `this.props.increment();`.
