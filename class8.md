# Operators and Loops

# Assignment Operators
------------------
Assignment -> `x = f()` = `x = f()`

Addition Assignment -> `x += f()` = `x = x + f()`

Subtraction Assignment -> `x -= f()` = `x = x - f()`

Multiplication Assignment -> `x *= f()` = `x = x * f()`

Division Assignment -> `x /= f()` = `x = x / f()`

Remainder Assignment -> `x %= f()` = `x = x % f()`

Exponentiation Assignment -> `x **= f()` = `x = x ** f()`

Logical AND Assignment -> `x &&= f()` = `x && (x = f())`

Logical OR Assignment -> `x ||= f()` = `x || (x = f())`

# Comparison Operators
------------------
Equal -> `==`

Not Equal -> `!=`

Strict Equal -> `===`

Strict Not Equal -> `!==`

Greater Than -> `>`

Greater Than or Equal -> `>=`

Less Than -> `<`

# What is a 'Loop'?

A quick and easy way of using JavaScript to run code repeatedly.

# What is a 'For Loop'?

A **for loop** repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

# What is a 'While Loop'?

A **while loop** executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
