# CSS Layout

## Types of CSS Positioning Schemes
1. Static Positioning (Normal Flow) - Default positioning. Sits where it sits in the HTML
2. Relative Positioning - Can be moved out of its normal flow or position. Will still take up the same space. It's relative to itself; offset. Used by a "parent."
3. Absolute Positioning - Is relative to its "parent." Can be taken out of its normal flow / positioning. Leaves no space behind.
4. Fixed Positioning - Is relative to the document body.
5. Floating Elements - Content flows around it.
