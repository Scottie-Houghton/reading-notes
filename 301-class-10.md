## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
1. What is a ‘call’?
* An invocation of a function.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
* Only one call can happen at a time. Called from top to bottom.
3. What does LIFO mean?
* Last In, First Out
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
```
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```
5. What causes a Stack Overflow? 
* When there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

## JavaScript error messages
1. What is a ‘reference error’?
* When you try to use a variable that has not yet been declared.
2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
* When you have something that cannot be parsed because the syntax is wrong.
3. What is a ‘range error’?
* When you manipulate with length causing it to give an invalid length.
4. What is a ‘type error’?
* When a type you are trying to use or access is incompatible.
5. What is a breakpoint?.
* When you're debugging, it marks where you want the code to stop running.
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
* It adds a breakpoint in the line of the code it is put in.
