## CRUD Basics

* `PUT`
2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
* `PUT` and `DELETE` (or for `GET` if you're only reading one)

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API
1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
* REST is the way two systems talk to each other (like a server and a client), and CRUD are the actions you use to write data to a database. The client might use REST to communicate to the server, and then the server will use that information to interact with the database. 
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
* Figure out what your Object Model is
* Figure out the unique identifier of your resource
* Decide on the content and format of your resource
* Make routes to perform all your HTTP Methods
* Handle your errors
