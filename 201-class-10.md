## Execution Contexts
There are two types of execution contexts and each have a corresponding variable scope:
1. Global Context - code not found in a function that is part of the script as a whole; there is only one global context per page.
      * Global Scope - if a variable is declared outside a function, it can be used anywhere.
2. Function Context - code that is being run within a function; each function has its own context.
      * Function-level Scope - when a variable is declared within a function, it can only be used within that function.

## The Stack
When a statement calls some other code in order to do its job, the new task goes to the top of the queue. The previous statement won't be gotten to until the new task is complete. If yet another task is called by the new task, it then gets put on top of that, and needs to be completed before returning to the previous tasks is descending order.

## Hoisting
Hoisting is just another way of saying you are preparing variables and functions to be used later. There are two types of hoisting:
1. Call a function *before* is has been declared.
2. Assign a value to a variable that has not yet been declared.

## Error Objects
Error Objects can help you find where there might be a mistake in your code. An Error object will contain the following properties:

Property  ||  Description
`name`        Type of execution
`message`     Description
`fileNumber`  Name of the JavaScript file
`lineNumber`  Line number of error
