# Chart.js, Canvas

## What is  `<canvas>`?
The `<canvas>` element is similar to the `<img>` element except that it doesn't have the `src` and `alt` attributes. A lot of the time they use the `width` and `height` attributes, but theses are optional. Also, it is a good idea to include an `id` attribute to make it easy to identify it in a script. Also, unlike the `<img>` element, a closing tag (`</canvas>`) is required when using the `<canvas>` element.

The `<canvas>` element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more **rendering contexts**, which are used to create and manipulate the content show. The canvas is initially blank and a script needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. The `<canvas>` element uses a method called `getContext()`, which is used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions.

Here is a skeleton template that will show you one way you can get started using `<canvas>`:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>Canvas tutorial</title>
    <script>
      function draw() {
        var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');
        if (canvas.getContext) {
          var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
        }
      }
    </script>
    <style>
      canvas { border: 1px solid black; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body onload="draw();">
    <canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
  </body>
</html>
```

## What is Chart.js?
Chart.js is a JavaScript plugin and templates you can use to insert charts and graphs into a `<canvas>` element to display data that you can hard code, or use JavaScript functions to collect and then display data.
