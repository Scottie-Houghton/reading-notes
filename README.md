## About me

Since graduating from the University of Washington in 2004, I have gained experience in many different roles in multiple industries of the professional world. My most recent positions have found me focusing on office management and being part of administrative, personnel and support staffs. Other past experience includes working in live music production and music marketing and promotion. Looking for a career pivot, I decided to sign up for Code Fellows' program with the hope of a long, successful journey into the tech world.

In my free time, I enjoy attending live shows at my favorite music venues and hanging out with friends at our local haunts in my neighborhood (sometimes while singing karaoke). During the Spring and Summer, I can be found camping or watching my beloved Mariners at the ballpark. While in the Fall and Winter, I look forward to bowling every Tuesday on my league or finding pub trivia nights to test my knowledge.
