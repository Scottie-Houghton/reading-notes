# What does *Growth Mindset* mean to me?

While someone may be inherently intelligent or talented at something, everyone has the potential to develop their knowledge and gain new abilities. Through dedication and hard work, anyone can achieve their goals.

When thinking about *Growth Mindset*, I appreciated learning this quote from **Alfred Binet**, the inventor of the IQ test:

> *"A few modern philosophers assert that an individual's intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement and literally to become more intelligent than we were before."*

## 3 Reminders to Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset
1. Sometimes the best way to learn is to fix something that's broken; especially when you're the one who broke it.
2. We're all learning and growing in this world; be inspired by those around you and help each other reach your goals.
3. Success requires effort; no pain, no gain.
