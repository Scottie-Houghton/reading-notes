# React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms
1. What is a 'Controlled Component'?
* In HTML, form elements typically maintain their own state and updated based on the user input. Input is only updated with `setState()` in React, so it is kept in the state property of components in React. The component in React that renders a form also controls what happens in that form the next time there is user input.
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why
* The latter because state is always running behind, so when you submit, it won't be available right away, as opposed to if you update as a response is being entered.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
* Have a value attribute in the input field along with the event handler.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
* To shorten `if` statements into one line of code.
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
> if(x===y){
>   console.log(true);
> } else {
>   console.log(false);
> }
* `x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);`
