# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts
1. What is functional programming?
* A concept that builds side effect-free functions, so it is easier to maintain systems.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
* A pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments.
* A pure function does not cause any observable side affects.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
* Pure functions make code easier to test.
4. What is immutability?
* It is data whose state cannot change after it's created
5. What is Referential transparency?
* When a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()
1. What is a module?
* You can organize your Node.JS application by splitting it up into functional parts. Each module has a certain functionality in the application. Then we call it when we want it to do what it does. Each module will be its own JavaScript file.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
* Makes the function of another module available to use in another JavaScript file.
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
* `require('./<<name of module's JS file>>');`
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
* `module.exports = <<name of function variable>>;` at the bottom of the module and then assign the `require()` a variable in the file the module is being brought into.
