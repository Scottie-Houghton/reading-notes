# Structure Web Pages with HTML

# What is a Wireframe?

A wireframe is an outline of a website with all the content missing along with the along with all the components of how it's displayed (colors, typeface choices, text, etc.) Without that distraction, you can see how a user would interact with and navigate around the layout of the site.

# What is HTML?

HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It is the structure the content is placed in, so that the content appears or acts in a certain way. A line of HTML code is called an **element**. To do something to content within an element, you need to surround it with tags; an **opening tag** and a **closing tab**

# Common Tags

`<h1>``</h>` = heading level `(6 total)`

`<ol>``</ol>` = ordered list

`<li>``</li>` = list item

`<i>``</i>` = italicized

`<strong>``</strong>` = bold

`<a href="">``</a>` = anchor/link `(link in quotes)`

`<img src="">` = image `(image link in quotes; no closing tag)`
