# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother
1. Who is Roy Fielding?
* Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. He also did a lot of research that explained why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol (HTTP) that is used to get pages from servers to the browser.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
* According to the reading:
> "Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines."
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* It tells the browser what protocol to use. That protocol makes it possible to locate something from anywhere, kind of like GPS coordinates.
4. What does a `GET` do?
* A system retrieves information from another system.
5. What does a `POST` do?
* Adding something to a system from another system.
6. What does `PUT` do?
* Replacing something in a system by another system.
7. What does `PATCH` do?
* A system partially updates another system.
