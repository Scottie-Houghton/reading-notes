# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

# What is JavaScript?

If HTML is the skeleton, and CSS is the skin, Javascript are the muscles. JavaScript allows users to interact with the site and make it do things, and allows programmers to have the website make the users interact with it.

# Variables

What are variables? Well, they are basically just labels given to a container that stores data. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring." This is done with the command `var`, `let` or `const`. After the command, you need to give the variable a name (preceded by a space), which is called the identifer.

## Identifier Naming Convention
* `$` and `_` are considered letters in JavaScript
* They can contain letters and digits
* They are case sensitive
* Reserved words cannot be used as names
