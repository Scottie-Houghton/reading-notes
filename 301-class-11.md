# Mongo and Mongoose

## NoSQL vs SQL
1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
```
|                 SQL                 |                 NoSQL                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Relational Database                 | Non-relational or distributed         |
| Table based database                | Key-value pairs, docs, etc.           |
| Predefined schema                   | Dynamic schema - unstructured data    |
| Vertically scalable                 | Horizontally scalable                 |
| SQL for defining & manipulate data  | Queries focused on collection of docs |
```
2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? Give a real world example.
* Complex queries - Organizing Users and Products and then making order combining the two.
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Give a real world example.
* For the type of data to be stored - Collecting more user data as your company grows; the type and amount of data you collected might change from when you first started.
4. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
* SQL because it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data.
5. Which type of database is best for scalability?
*  NoSQL because you can easily add more servers in its database infrastructure to handle large traffic.

## NoSQL vs SQL (video)
1. What does SQL stand for?
* Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database? 
* A database that works with certain assumptions or in a certain way.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
* It uses tables that stores data ("data bin," "storage container").
4. What is a ‘schema’?
* There are very strict requirements for the data that's stored in the database tables (which data can go into a table). This is called a 'schema' and they are defined by fields.
5. What is a NoSQL database?
* The structure doesn't require a schema.
6. How does it work?
* You can have multiple documents in your collection of data that have different fields.
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
* Different collections of many documents where relation isn't as important
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
* MongoDB, because it doesn't have to adhere to a format like a SQL with its schema.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
* If data needs to be changed, you have to change in all the collections.
