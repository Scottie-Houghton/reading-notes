# APIs

## API Design Best Practices
1. What does REST stand for?
* Representational State Transfer
2. REST APIs are designed around a ____.
* resource
3. What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.
* It is a URI that uniquely identifies a resource. Like, if you want to see a specific order on a retail website similar to something like this: `https://adventure-works.com/orders/1`
4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?
* `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`
5. What should the URIs be based on?
* They should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).
6. Give an example of a good URI
* `https://adventure-works.com/orders`
7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
* It's when the web APIs exposes a large number of small resources. This should be avoided because it may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all the data it needs. You want to retrieve as much data as possible in a single request.
8. What status code does a successful `GET` request return?
* 200 (OK)
9. What status code does an unsuccessful `GET` request return?
* 404 (Not Found)
10. What status code does a successful `POST` request return?
* 201 (Created)
11. What status code does a successful `DELETE` request return?
* 204 (No Content)
