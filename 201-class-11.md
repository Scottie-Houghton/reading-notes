## Controlling Image Size in CSS
A lot of the times, it's good to specify image size because it helps the page to load more smoothly. The HTML and CSS code will load first, so knowing how much space to leave for the image allows it to render the rest of the page first without waiting for the image to download. To keep the html less busy, it's probably a good idea to use CSS to control the dimension than having it inline throughout the HTML document. To modify the dimensions of a specific image, you can give it a 'class' attribute and use it in a selector in CSS like so: `img.large {`.

## Aligning Images Using CSS
Instead of using the align attribute in HTML to float an image, you can us the 'float' property in CSS to move the image element to the left of right of its containing block. You can also put `align-left` or `align-right` in the class attribute to help with floating the images to where you want them. Then you can add a few pixels to the right or left margin, so that the text isn't touching the edge of the image.

## Centering Images using CSS
By default, images are inline elements. Therefore, it needs to be turned into a block-level element using the `display` property. Then, you can either use the `text-align` property with the value of `center`, or you can use the `margin` property and set the values of the left and right margins to `auto`.

## Background Images
The `background-image` property allows you to have an image as a background behind any HTML element. The path to the image follows the letters `url`, and is put inside parentheses and quotes like this: `background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");`.

## Values of `background-repeat` and `background-attachment` Properties
`repeat` - background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.

`repeat-x` - background image is repeated horizontally only

`repeat-y` - background image is repeated vertically only

`no-repeat` - background image is only shown once

`fixed` - background image stays in the same position on the page

`scroll` - background image moves up and down as the user scrolls

## Values of the `background-position` Property
Here are the following values: `left top`, `left center`, `left bottom`, `center top`, `center center`, `center bottom`, `right top`, `right center` and `right bottom`. You can also use a pair of pixels or percentages. `0% 0%` equals the top left of the browser window (or containing box), so `50% 50%` would center the image both horizontally and vertically.
