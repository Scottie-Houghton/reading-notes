# State and Props

## React Lifecycle
1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
* According to the diagram, 'render' happens before 'componentDidMount'.
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
* Mounting is the first of three phases in the lifecycle of React; followed by Updating and then Unmounting.
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen:
* `constructor`
* `render`
* `React Updates`
* `componentDidMount`
* `componentWillUnmount`
4. What does `componentDidMount` do?
* If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, pass it through this method, which is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.

## React State vs. Props
1. What types of things can you pass in the props?
* Things that are not going to change and remain static.
2. What is the big difference between props and state?
* Props you pass into a component and state is handled inside a component (therefore, you can also say that props are handled outside a component).
3. When do we re-render our application?
* When you change the state inside of your application it will re-render that section of your application.
4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
* In a counter application, state stores the current, up-to-date count beyond the initial count.
* Input entered into a form by a user.
