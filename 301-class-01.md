# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture
1. What is a "component"?
* A component is a building block with a defined purpose that you can use, usually with other components, to form an application.
2. What are the characteristics of a component?
* A compnonent is **reusable**, either in different situations in different applications, or they are just used for one specific task.
* A component is **replaceable** and can be substituted with other similare component.
* The operation of a component is **not context specific** and be used in different environments.
* Its **extensibility** allows a component to provide new behavior when extended from another component.
* The **encapsulation** of a component protects the details of its internal processes or any of its internal variables or state.
* Its **independence** prevents a component from having dependencies on other components.
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
* The **ease of deployment** makes it easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
* The use of third-part components **reduces the cost** of deployement and maintenance.
* The **reusuability** of components means they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
* Components **modify the technial complexity** through the use of a component containers and their services.
* The **reliability** of components enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
* The ease of changing and updating the implementation of components helps with **system maintenance and evolution** since it does so without affecting the rest of the system.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React
1. What is "props" short for?
* **"Props"** stands for **properties** and they are used to pass data from one component to another.
2. How are props used in React?
* Props are defined in the child component, then the data is passed to the parent component and then rendered by the parent component.
3. What is the flow of props?
* Props can only be passed one way, from a parent component to its child component, which is called **uni-directional flow**.
