# HTML Tables

This code:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>45</td>
    <td>60</td>
    <td>45</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>60</td>
    <td>90</td>
    <td>90</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Will output this:
```
15 15 30
45 60 45
60 90 90
```

<br/>

Add headings with code like this:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Saturday</th>
    <th>Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tickets sold:</th>
    <td>120</td>
    <td>135</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Total sales:</th>
    <td>$600</td>
    <td>$675</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
The first table row is a blank cell and then to header cells that will become the headings "Saturday" and "Sunday." The second header row starts with a table header element that will create the row header "Tickets sold:" and is then followed by two table data elements. The third row is similar to the second, except it will have a row header of "Total sales:". Browsers usually display the content of `<th>` element in bold and in the middle of the cell.
