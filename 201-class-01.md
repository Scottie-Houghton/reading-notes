# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## What is HTML?

HTML describes the structure of a web page to the web browser so it knows how to display it. It does so by bookending the content with HTML **elements**. Most elements are made up of two **tags**, and opening and a closing tag. In a tag you will find character or characters, that indicates what the element does, surrounded by a left-angle bracket and a right-angle bracket on their respective sides (a closing tag also includes a forward slash after the left-angle bracket).

## Basic Structure of a Web Page

`<!DOCTYPE html>` (Indicates what version of HTML is being used)
`<html>` (This element bookends all the HTML code)
`  <head>` (Contains information *about* the page)
`    <title></title>` (This is the title found at the top of a brower window or tab)
`  </head>`
`  <body>` (This element bookends everything a user sees on a webpage)
`    <header>` (This element is found at the top of a page)
`      <h1></h1>` (The largest font of a heading)
`    </header>`
`    <main>` (The majority of content is found in this section)
`      <p></p>` (Element that indicates a paragraph)
`    </main>`
`    <footer></footer>` (This element is found at the bottom of a page)
`  </body>`
`</html>`
