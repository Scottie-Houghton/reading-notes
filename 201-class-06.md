# Objects

## What is an Object?
An object creates a model of something by grouping a set of variables and functions. Variables within objects are called properties. Just like variable outside of objects, they have a name and a value, but the name is called a key in objects. Functions within objects are call methods.

Objects are stored in a variable. Here is an example from the Duckett JS book of how an object is typed out:

```
let hotel = {
  name: 'Quay',
  rooms: 40,
  booked: 25,
  checkAvailability: function () {
    return this.room - this booked;
  }
};
```

Notice after each property, you need to have a comma. When referring back to a property of the object you are in, you can type `this.` and the key.

You can access a property or method of an object by using dot notation (`let roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();`), or you can access a property (but not a method) using square bracket syntax (`let hotelName = hotel['name'];`).
