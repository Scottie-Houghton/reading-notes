# Images, Color, Text

## How do you add images to your site?
One of the first things you'll want to do is create a child folder, so you'll have a place to store all the images you'll need for your site. You can even keep it simple and just call it "images," and all every image can go there, or you can even make subfolders if you have a lot of images and want to organize them more.

When working with HTML, to add an image to your page you'll use the `<img>` element. It is an empty element, which means there is no closing tag. All image element must contain the attributes 'src' and 'alt.' The 'src' attribute is what tells the browser where to find the image, whether it be an external URL to another site, or a relative URL. The 'alt' attribute tells the user what the image is if cannot be seen and it is what screen reader software and search engines use when looking at images on your site. The 'title' attribute is optional; its content will usually be displayed in a tooltip when it is hovered over. Also, you are able to adjust the size of an image with the 'height' and 'width' attributes.

## Foreground and Background Colors
The foreground color is the color of the text inside an element. The property is written out like this: `color`. If you want to set a color for the background behind the text, you will use this property: `background-color`. The value can be expressed in three different ways: RGB values, hex codes or color names. Below contains an example of these three ways:

```
/* color name */
h1 {
  color: DarkCyan;}
/* hex code */
h2 {
  color: #ee3e80;}
/* rgb value */
p {
  color: rgb(100,100,90);}
```
