# Putting it all togethers

## React Docs - Thinking in React
1. What is the `single responsibility principle` and how does it apply to components?
* A component should only be doing one thing. If you have some data that you need a user to interact with, break up the data so that each piece is handled by one component.
2. What does it mean to build a 'static' version of your application?
* Building a version that takes your data model and renders the UI, but doesn't have any interactivity yet.
3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
* To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with `state`.
4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
* Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
* Does it remain unchanged over time? Is so, it probably isn't state.
* Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.
4. How can you identify where state needs to live?
* Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
* Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that needs the state in the heirarchy).
* Either the common owner or another component higher up in heirarchy should own the state.
* If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the heirarchy above the common owner component.

## Higher Order Functions
1. What is a "higher-order function"?
* Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
2. Explore the `greaterThan` function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
* It is a function within a function that allows you to choose a number you want to test if something is greater than against.
3. Explain how either `map` or `reduce` operates, with regard to higher-order functions.
* `reduce` method takes the data in an array and manipulates it and turns it into something new.
