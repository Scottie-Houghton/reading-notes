# CRUD

## Status Codes Based On REST Methods
1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
* 100's = Informational - just telling the client they are doing what they ask.
* 200's = Success - Everything met at time of request send.
* 300's = Redirection - Something is not where it was expected to be so the client's request is going to a new location.
* 400's = Client error codes - User error!
* 500's = Server error codes - Something is wrong on the server end.
2. What is a status code 202?
* Accepted - A success code used during asynchronous processing of a request.
3. What is a status code 308?
* Permanent Redirect - don't use the current URL entered and to use another one.
4. What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
* 204 No Content
5. What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
* 410 Gone
6. What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
* 403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick
1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
* Because `.env` is where we store sensitive information and it is included in the `.gitignore`, so that it isn't included in our ACP.
2. What is middleware?
* Code that runs when the server gets a request, but before it gets passed to your routes.
3. What does `app.use(express.json())` do?.
* Lets a server accepts `.json` as a body instead of a post element or get element, etc.
4. What does the `/:id` mean in a route?
* The colon means it's a parameter, so the route knows to look for a specific value of that parameter.
5. What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?
* `PATCH` updates just the information that gets passed while `PUT` updates all the information.
6. How do you make a default value in a schema?
* In the object of the schema key you want a default value, just make sure you have a property of the key say `default:` followed by what you want it to be if nothing is entered.
7. What does a `500` error status code mean?
* Means there is an error on the server.
8. What is the difference between a status `200` and a status `201`?
* `200` is a general success status while `201` means you, more specificially, successfully created something.
