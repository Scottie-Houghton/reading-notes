# Forms

A form element in HTML, naturally, begins with the `<form>` element. Usually a form element needs to contain a combination of 3 attributes: action (where to store the info entered), method (two types) and id. "Get" methods adds the responses to the URL in the action and "post" methods are sent in an HTTP header - "get" is the default.

To collect responses, you need to use the `<input>` element. You'll want to have a "name" attribute, so that it is known where responses were entered. By adding a "type" attribute, you can say how you want to collect responses. The different "types" of inputs are: text, password, radio button, checkbox and file.

There is also a `<textarea>` element for multi-line text input. You can use the element `<select>`, follow by the elements called `<option>`, to make a drop down list. You can have the drop down be able to have more than one selected by adding the attribute `multiple="multiple"` in the `<select>` element.

You can group related questions together in a form using the `<fieldset>` element, and then even put a caption around them by having a `<legend>` element after the `<fieldset>` element. You can also add a label by surrounding the `<input>` element with a `<label>` element. Finally, when you are done with the form, you can add a `<button>` element for submitting the form.
