# Authentication

## What is OAuth?
1. What is OAuth?
> "OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization."
2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
* One of the most common examples is when you go to log onto a website and it gives you a few options of how to log in. Some of those options might be using other websites' or services' logon. You click on a button and get authenticated by the other website or service, and then the original website logs you on itself.
3. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
* First website connects to the second website.
* Second site creates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
* The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user's client software.
* The client's software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider
* If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
* The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
* The user is given an approved access token.
* The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
* The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
* The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
* The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
4. What is OpenID?
* Another method used to log users into places. Instead of being an **authorization** method like OAuth, it uses **authentication**. As was quoted in the article, "OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans." OpenID wanted to serve as a single sign-in, vouching for the identities of users, instead of having multiple logins for multiple websites. It's original use was to log users into LiveJournal, but fell out of favor because of services like Facebook Connect.

## Authorization and Authentication flows
1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
* **Authentication** is telling a system who you are, while **authorization** defines what you can do according to who you are.
2. What is Authorization Code Flow?
* They are used for server-side apps since the source code is not publicly exposed. It exchanges and Authorization Code for a token
3. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
* When Authorization Code flow is enhanced by a PKCE, a secret created by the calling application (known as a Code Verifier) is introduced that can be verified by the authorization server.
4. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
* It requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls. With this method, you donâ€™t need to obtain, maintain, use, and protect a secret in your application.
5. What is Client Credentials Flow?
* With machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user.
6. What is Device Authorization Flow?
* For devices that are harder to enter text in, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone to authorize the device.
7. What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
* It requests that users provide credentials. This should only be used by highly-trusted applications.
