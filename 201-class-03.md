# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML Lists
1. Ordered list - each item of the list is numbered
2. Unordered list - each item of the list is identified by a bullet point
3. Definition list - terms are identified and then their definition is listed below

### Example of an Ordered List
```
<ol>
  <li>Bring water to boil in pan</li>
  <li>Stir in noodles; cook for 7-8 min</li>
  <li>Drain noodles & return to pan</li>
  <li>Add butter, milk & cheese; mix well</li>
</ol>
```

### Example of an Unordered List
```
<ul>
  <li>7.25 oz. of noodles</li>
  <li>6 cups of water</li>
  <li>4 Tbsp. of butter</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of milk</li>
  <li>1/2 cup of melted cheese</li>
</ul>
```

### Example of a Nested List
```
<ul>
  <li>Coke</li>
  <li>7-up</li>
  <li>Soda Water</li>
  <li>Orange Juice</li>
  <li>Cranberry Juice</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Liquor</li>
      <li>Beer</li>
      <li>Red Wine</li>
      <li>White Wine</li>
      <li>Sparkling</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Water</li>  
</ul>
```

### Example of a Definition List
```
<dl>
  <dt>Sashimi</dt>
  <dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with condiments such as shredded daikon radish or ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
  <dt>Scale</dt>
  <dd>A device used to accurately measure the weight of ingredients</dd>
  <dd>A technique by which the scales are removed from the skin of a fish</dd>
  <dt>Scamorze</dt>
  <dt>Scamorzo</dt>
  <dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole cow's milk (although it was traditionally made with buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>
```

## What is the CSS Box Model?
When thinking about how CSS affects an element in HTML, we use the **CSS Box Model**. Other than the content, the CSS Box Model has three properties that can be adjusted: the **margin**, **border** and **padding**.

### Definition of the CSS Box Model Properties
1. Margin - The outer most property of the CSS Box Model. You can adjust the width of the margin to create a gap between boxes or the edges of the web page.
2. Border - In from the margin is the border. It separates the edge of on box from another.
3. Padding - It is the space between the border of a box and any content within the box.

## What is an Array?
An **array** is a special kind of variable that stores a list of values, rather than just one. When writing out an array, it looks like this: `let soda = ['Cola', 'Lemon-Lime', 'Root Beer'];`.

The values of an array are indexed starting with 0. So, in the previous example, to access the value 'Cola' from the array, you need to write the code like this: `let typeOne = soda[0];`.
