# Local Storage
Web applications are at a disadvantage compared to native applications when it comes to persistent local storage of data.

## The 3 Potentially Dealbreaking Downsides to Cookies
1. Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over.
2. Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet.
3. Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data -- enough to slow down your application, but not enough to be terribly useful.

### What We Really Want
* A lot of storage space.
* On the client.
* That persists beyond a page refresh.
* And isn't transmitted to the server.

## The Problem HTML5 Set Out to Solve:
Provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers, without having to rely on third-party plugins.

## So What is HTML5 Storage?
According to the article “The Past, Present & Future of Local Storage for Web Applications,” HTML5 Storage, also sometimes referred to as 'Local Storage,' is:

> *Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.*
