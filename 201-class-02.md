# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## HTML Elements That Affects Text
------------------
`<h1>``</h>` = heading level (6 total)

`<p>``</p>` = paragraph

`<i>``</i>` = italicized

`<b>``</b>` = bold

`<sup>``</sup>` = superscript

`<sub>``</sub>` = subscript

`<br />` = line break (no closing tag)

`<hr />` = horizontal rule (no closing tag)

`<abbr title="What Text Stands For">``</abbr>` = abbreviation / acronym

`<ins>``</ins>` = insert / underline

`<s>``</s>` = strikethrough

## What is CSS?

CSS lets you customize your site further. While HTML focuses more on the structure, web browsers do style the content, but in their default and very basic way. With CSS, you apply style rules to and element, or group of elements, to make them look a certain way.

## What makes up a CSS rule?

Here is an example of some CSS code:

```
h1, h2, h3 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

p {
    color: green;
    font-weight: bolder;
}
```

Let's break it down:
* Here are two rules. The first one will affect all headings of sizes one, two and three and make them align center and make the color of the text red. The second one will make the text of every paragraph element green and make them bold.
* The first thing in a rule is a selector. It selects the HTML element you are going to style. For the example above, we are styling any `<h1>`, `<h2>` and `<h3>` element with the first rule and any `<p>` element with the second rule.
* All the stylings in a rule need to surrounded by curly braces `{ }`.
* The styling comes in the form of **declarations**, which include a **property** and a **value**, respectively. As you can see, they are separated by a colon and a space and the declaration ends with a semi-colon.
* If you want to be more specific about what element(s) your style will affect, you can assign an 'id' or 'class' to an element (ex: `<p id="imp-graph">`; `<nav class="nav-bar2">`). Select the element to style by typing `#` or `.`, respectively, then the name (ex: `#imp-graph`; `.nav-bar2`).

## Three Ways to Insert CSS
1. External CSS - A style sheet saved with a .css extension. A reference to the external style sheet must be included in the HTML page inside the head section inside a `<link>` element (ex: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`).
2. Internal CSS - A style sheet inserted right onto the HTML page. It needs to be in the head section inside a `<style>` element.
3. Inline CSS - A style used to apply a unique style to a single element. It is coded right into the opening tag (ex: `<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">`). Inline style has the highest priority.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript gives the web browser instructions for it to follow and can even make it possible for users to interact with the website.

## What is a variable?

A variable is a way of labeling and organizing data. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called **declaring**. However, you don't necessarily need to have have any data to declare variables. There are 5 different types of data.

## Types of Data
1. Strings - characters surrounded by single quotes that represent text (ex: `let dog = 'woof';`)
2. Number - intergers and decimals, both positive or negative (ex: `let quantity = 10;`)
3. Booleans - statement that outputs true or false (ex: `let inStock = true;`)
4. Undefined - a variable that has been defined yet (ex: `let dog;`)
5. Null - a variale that has been defined as none (ex: `let dog = null;`)

## Variable Naming Convention
* `$` and `_` are considered letters in JavaScript
* They can contain letters and digits
* They are case sensitive
* Reserved words cannot be used as names
* Camel case is the industry standard (ex: camelCase)

## Operators
1. Assignment - just a single value, like a number or text between single quotes (ex: `color = 'beige';`)
2. Arithmetic - basic math problems (ex: `area = 3 * 2;`)
3. String - combining two or more strings (ex: `greeting = 'Hi, ' + 'Scottie';`)
4. Comparison - return true or false after comparing two values (ex: `buy = 3 > 5;`)
5. Logical - return true or false after combining expressions (ex: `buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);`)

### Comparison Operators
* `==` - loosely equal to
* `===` - strictly equal to
* `!=` - loosely *not* equal to
* `!==` - strictly *not* equal to
* `>` - greater than
* `<` - less than
* `>=` - greater than or equal to
* `<=` - less than or equal to

### Logical Operators
* `&&` - and
* `||` - or
* `!` - not; opposite of what it's in front of (ex: `!true`)
