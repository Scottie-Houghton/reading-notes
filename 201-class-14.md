## "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team"

Excerpts from the article that stuck with me:

> "Yet many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as 'employee performance optimization' — isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that 'the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more' over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues."

> "In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction."

> "As they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as 'group norms.' Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team."

> "What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the 'good' teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright."

> "As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as 'equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.'"

> "Second, the good teams all had high 'average social sensitivity' — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

> "Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like 'conversational turn-taking' and 'average social sensitivity' as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a 'shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.'"

> "What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a 'work face' when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home."
